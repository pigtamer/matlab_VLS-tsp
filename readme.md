# VLS-tsp

This is a matlab-based library for solving large scale TSP problem, e.g. whose scales are larger than 100,000 nodes.

This work was inspired by the idea of hierarchal clustering. We have tested this lib on public datasets provided by TSPLib and National TSP. The resulting length is within 90% of the best ever ones.
